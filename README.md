# Uzebox controller PCB

This dual layer, 57mm x 76mm Uzebox controller PCB was created using [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/) by [Uzebox forum](https://uzebox.org/forums/index.php) member altella with help from taylor-madeak and danboid.

Despite the name the current version of this PCB does not work with the Super Nintendo.

See the [Uzebox Joystick wiki page](https://uzebox.org/wiki/Joystick) for more info on how to use this PCB.
